# Prism
Prism is a technological solution to an important problem society faces todayâ€”helping neurotypical people to empathize with those on the autism spectrum. Working initially with 3rd and 4th graders at the Beech Bottom Primary School in in Brooke County, West Virginia, the team behind Prism is creating the tools to help a generation of children grow up with increased awareness and understanding for their autistic peers. If successful, the technology that powers Prism can be expanded to reach additional age groups, parents of autistic children, educators, and beyond.
