            <line character="fox">Why does everyone always call me “Fox?” You know my name is Spencer.</line>
            <line character="owl">Fox, the water levels are rising and a massive flood is coming.</line>
            <line character="wolf">Our only hope is to |b|build a very large dam|/b| to stop the flood.</line>
            <line character="fox">OK. Why can’t the beavers build it?</line>
            <line character="wolf">...They’ve gone missing. Nobody has seen them for days.</line>
            <line character="owl">We don’t have much time. Without the beavers, we’ll need |b|all the animals|/b| in our forest to work |b|together|/b| to build a dam of this size.</line>

            <line character="wolf">But you will need to |b|go out in the daytime|/b| to talk to some animals.</line>

            <line character="fox">...but it got better when I howled.</line>
            <line character="owl">I’m glad to hear it. It would be hard for me too if I were out in the daytime.</line>
            <line character="fox">It’s much easier at night.</line>
